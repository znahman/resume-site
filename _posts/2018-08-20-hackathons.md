Ever since my first hackathon, <a href="http://zachnahman.com/projects/hackcu-labor-log/" target="blank">(HackCU IV)</a>, I've become addicted to hackathons. They're the perfect opportunity to dive into a new project, work with a team, and develop something awesome. Usually, hackathons are competitions with prizes. However, even if a prize is not earned the experience is still extremely valuable and education.

## Hackalong Horizons
I competed in my first ever online hackathon called Hackalong Horizons put on by the twitch community. You can find a write-up of my experience here: <a href="http://zachnahman.com/projects/hackalonghorizons/" target="blank">Hackalong Horizons Experience</a>

An online hackathon is a super creative idea! Unfortunately for this one I did not have a team, but I still learned a ton working by myself.

## GlobalHack 7
In the middle of October, I'm traveling to St. Louis, Missouri to participate in <a href="https://globalhack.org/globalhack7/" target="blank">GlobalHack 7</a> . The goal for global hack 7 is to create tools to improve experiences for foreign-born individuals in St. Louis and beyond. This hackathon will not just be a learning experience but also works towards a noble humanitarian cause. I am very excited to attend!

## Our Own Hackathon?
I've been toying with the idea of hosting a hackathon, perhaps at CSM. Stay tuned...
