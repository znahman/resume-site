<h3>Description:</h3>
Participated in the NASA 2015 Robotic Mining Competition held at the Kennedy Space Center. Our team was tasked with designing a robotic rover capable of traversing an obstacle field, excavating planetary surface simulant (regolith), and depositing the regolith into a collection bin. I served as the Lead Mechanical Engineer for the excavation subsystem, and designed a bucket ladder excavation system. I also served as the team's Liaison and was responsible for all communications with NASA. We won 2nd place in the Presentation and Demonstration category.
