<h3>Description:</h3>
The goal of the UGV (unmanned ground vehicle) and UAV (unmanned air vehicle) teaming project is to develop a system of robots that can behave autonomously in an underground (or enclosed) environment. Preliminary work has proven that a drone can be set up to automatically follow a ground vehicle at a threshold distance above.
