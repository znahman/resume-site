<h3>Description:</h3>
Traditional robotic automation thrives in manufacturing environments that repeatedly weld a small mixture of welded assemblies (low mixture of parts and high volume of output). Many manufacturing industries, such as the shipbuilding industry, produce small (relatively) amounts of a large number of welded assemblies (high mixture of parts and low volume of output). The labor and time cost of producing traditional robot programs for this high mixture of parts is astronomical. Enter: Computer Aided Robotics for Welding (CAR-W). Working with a project team for the National Shipbuilding Research Program (NSRP), Wolf Robotics is developing software to automatically generate welding programs based on ShipConstructor CAD model information to enable cost-effective use of robotic automation in high mix, low volume industries. My role on the project is on-site Applications Engineering and testing at the customer facility.
