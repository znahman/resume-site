<h3>Description:</h3>
The Newmont Innovation Challenge tasked our team with creating a pitch for innovative technology for use in the mining industry. As an answer to this challenge, our team of Mechanical Engineering and Computer Science graduate students is working to create a unit capable of automatic mapping in enclosed environments using only two RGB-D sensors. Similar units that perform mapping in enclosed environments use LiDAR sensors, but the use of this sensor is cost prohibitive. Our goal is to create software and sensor mounts for automatic mapping that is cost effective, efficient, and modular. Our sensor package can be mounted be handheld, mounted to a ground robot, or even mounted to a drone.
