<h3>Description:</h3>
The Newmont Innovation Challenge tasked our team with creating a pitch for innovative technology for use in the mining industry. As an answer to this challenge, our team of Mechanical Engineering and Computer Science graduate students proposed a novel approach to making underground mining operations safer and more productive utilizing a wireless, 3D sensor mesh network. The proof of concept of our technology was demonstrated using ROS, Astra RGBD cameras, and Velodyne LiDAR. <b>Our team won the Spring 2018 pitch competition earning access to $10,000+ in project funding.</b> We are working on a further feasibility study through the 2018-2019 school year. Stay tuned for updates.
